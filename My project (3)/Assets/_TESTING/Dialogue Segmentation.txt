Den as ??? "I'm sorry…" 
MC "What for?"
Den as ??? "You know…it was a tense conversation down there.{wa 1} They aren't the most welcoming people, but they learn to tolerate you with time."
Juno "Thank you….."
Den as ??? "Oh! My name's Den. I can't believe I forgot to introduce myself. How rude of me!"
Juno "Don't worry. You were one of the nicest,actually. And that girl...A-Aiko?"
Den "Aiko, yes, you got it right. It was me and her at first. Then came the others and hell broke loose. Nikolas is nice as well, but no one can compare to Aiko's kindness, she's like a sister to me."
